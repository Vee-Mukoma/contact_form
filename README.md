ðŸ’Œ Simple Contact Form (HTML + JS Display)

A cute and functional contact form built with HTML + CSS, with a sprinkle of JavaScript to display the form input on a second HTML page.



ðŸŒŸ What This Project Does

- Collects:
  - User name
  - Email
  - Issue type (query, feedback, etc.)
  - A short message
- Redirects to a second page
- Uses JavaScript to grab and display the form data from the URL



ðŸ§° Tech Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Google Fonts (Optional: Pacifico, Open Sans for cute vibes)



ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. User fills in index.html
2. On submit, theyâ€™re redirected to display.html
3. JavaScript reads the form values from the URL and displays them on the page
